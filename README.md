# Multivariable linear regression



## Project description
This machine learning algorithm is implemented using pure Python and NumPy. It predicts numerical values, and in this project, only numerical inputs are handled. Non-numerical inputs will be ignored.


Clone and change directory to project, then

	  ./setup.sh
	  source ../venv/bin/activate
	  python3 main.py [your csv path]
	  python3 predict.py [x1 x2 x3 x4 ..] Parameters must be numerical only and separated by spaces.
